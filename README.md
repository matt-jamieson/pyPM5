# pyPM5
A python package for interfacing with the Virginia Diodes PM5 terahertz powermeter. This works via the PM5() object which communicates to the powermeter with pyvisa, and interprets the results. The user can read powers and control the instrument, by changing the power range, cal factor, etc.
